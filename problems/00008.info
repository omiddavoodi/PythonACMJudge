Write a program that gets number n, and then gets n strings. For each of those strings, it should print G, which is defined as this:
G = the sum of M*N for each character in the string, where M is the position of the character, and N is the ascii number representing it.
For example: G, for 't' in "hotel", is 2 * 116.
Example:
Input:
2
salam
tolombe
Output:
1040
2192
