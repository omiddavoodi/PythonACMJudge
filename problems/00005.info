The Fiboncci sequence is defined as such:
F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2), F(1) = 1, F(2) = 1
Or in other words, each sequence is the sum of the two sequences before it. So some of the first sentences would be
1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, ...
Now you should write a program that gets number n, and then inputs n numbers and calculates the F(k) for each one. Then,
 it should print the 5 last digits of the result, followed by its 5 first digits. For example, if the result was 185423269584, it should print "6958418542".
You can suppose that the result always has more than or equal to 10 digits.
Example:
Input:
3
54
87
152
Output:
7127286267
1225867989
4654926099
