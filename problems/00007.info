For a pair of numbers like a and b, GCD, or "Greatest Common Divisor", is the largest integer that both a and b can be divided to. For example, the gcd of 8 and 6 is 2. GCD can be defined for more than one number, such that the GCD of n numbers like k1, k2, k3, k4, ..., kn, is the greatest integer which all of km are dividable to.
Now write a program that gets 5 numbers, and writes the gcd of those numbers in this format:
Result is [gcd]
Example:
Input:
4
6
12
82
16
Output:
Result is 2
